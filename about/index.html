		<h2>The Goal</h2>
		<p>The goal of this tool to help new and intermediate players make wise character choices that help them pick a well-balanced team.  I hope to ultimately improve the quality of pub play.  My goal is to keep the metrics used to only quantifiable/semi-quantifiable data, and to keep the tool as simple and as easy to use as possible.</p>
		<p>If you have any feedback or want to get involved, shoot me an email at [ellisd23] at [gmail] [dot] [com].</p>

		<h2>To do:</h2>
		<p>I'd like to get to all of these at some point.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ability to search by Dota 1 names</li>
			<li>Figure out a better UX for showing stats on heroes.  Right now they're hard to scan.</li>
			<li>Add hero "peaking" (i.e. when they are strong throughout the game)</li>
			<li>Add farm dependency</li>
			<li>Dim characteres who have roles filled</li>
			<li>Show heroes in Valve's grid display format</li>
			<li>Show lane matchups</li>
		</ul>
